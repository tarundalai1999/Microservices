E-Commerce Platform Deployment with Kubernetes & Microservices
Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a containerized e-commerce application on Kubernetes, leveraging microservices architecture for scalability and resilience. The infrastructure includes automated CI/CD pipelines, dynamic scaling, and comprehensive monitoring.

Key Features
Microservices Architecture
Decomposed monolithic application into independently deployable microservices

Implemented service discovery using Kubernetes native DNS

Configured inter-service communication with REST APIs and message queues

Used API Gateway pattern for request routing and composition

Implemented circuit breakers for fault tolerance

Containerization & Orchestration
Dockerized all application components and dependencies

Deployed on Kubernetes cluster for automated scheduling and management

Implemented health checks and readiness probes for all services

Configured resource requests/limits for optimal cluster utilization

Used ConfigMaps and Secrets for environment configuration

CI/CD Automation
Implemented end-to-end deployment pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions

Reduced deployment time by 35% through process optimization

Automated image builds and vulnerability scanning

Enabled blue-green deployments for zero-downtime releases

Integrated automated testing in CI pipeline

Scaling & Performance
Configured Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on CPU/memory metrics

Implemented cluster autoscaling for node-level elasticity

Optimized for peak traffic periods (e.g., holiday sales)

Used Redis for caching high-frequency requests

Implemented rate limiting for API protection

Monitoring & Observability
Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting

Grafana dashboards for real-time performance visualization

Centralized logging with EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana)

Distributed tracing with Jaeger for request flow analysis

Custom alerts for SLA violations and error rates
