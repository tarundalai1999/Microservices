# E-Commerce Platform Deployment with Kubernetes & Microservices

## Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a containerized e-commerce application on Kubernetes, leveraging microservices architecture for scalability and resilience. The infrastructure includes automated CI/CD pipelines, dynamic scaling, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Key Features

### üß© Microservices Architecture
- Decomposed monolithic application into independently deployable microservices
- Implemented service discovery using Kubernetes native DNS
- Configured inter-service communication with REST APIs and message queues
- Used API Gateway pattern for request routing and composition
- Implemented circuit breakers for fault tolerance

### üê≥ Containerization & Orchestration
- Dockerized all application components and dependencies
- Deployed on Kubernetes cluster for automated scheduling and management
- Implemented health checks and readiness probes for all services
- Configured resource requests/limits for optimal cluster utilization
- Used ConfigMaps and Secrets for environment configuration

### ‚ö° CI/CD Automation
- Implemented end-to-end deployment pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions
- Reduced deployment time by 35% through process optimization
- Automated image builds and vulnerability scanning
- Enabled blue-green deployments for zero-downtime releases
- Integrated automated testing in CI pipeline

### üìà Scaling & Performance
- Configured Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on CPU/memory metrics
- Implemented cluster autoscaling for node-level elasticity
- Optimized for peak traffic periods (e.g., holiday sales)
- Used Redis for caching high-frequency requests
- Implemented rate limiting for API protection

### üìä Monitoring & Observability
- Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting
- Grafana dashboards for real-time performance visualization
- Centralized logging with EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana)
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger for request flow analysis
- Custom alerts for SLA violations and error rates
